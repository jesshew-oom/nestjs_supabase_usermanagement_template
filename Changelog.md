### Technical Implementation

#### Vector Document Storage

```sql
-- Enable the vector extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector WITH SCHEMA extensions;

-- Create the vector_documents table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.vector_documents (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,
  embedding extensions.vector(1024),
  text_content text NOT NULL,
  title text NOT NULL,
  timestamp date NOT NULL,
  ai_title text,
  ai_description text,
  ai_maintopics text[],
  ai_keyentities text[],
  filter_tags text,
  page_number integer NOT NULL,
  total_pages integer NOT NULL,
  chunk_number integer NOT NULL,
  total_chunks integer NOT NULL,
  primary_language text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  CONSTRAINT vector_documents_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT vector_documents_unique_chunk UNIQUE (user_id, title, "timestamp", page_number, chunk_number),
  CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
-- Note: PostgreSQL currently does not support indexing vectors with more than 2,000 dimensions. If you have hundreds of thousands of documents resulting in hundreds of thousands of vectors, you need to use an embedding model that produces 2,000 dimensions or fewer.

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vector_documents_user_id ON public.vector_documents USING btree (user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vector_documents_lookup ON public.vector_documents USING btree (
  user_id,
  title,
  "timestamp",
  page_number,
  chunk_number
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.vector_documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Optimized RLS Policies for vector_documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can only read their own documents"
ON public.vector_documents
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (user_id = (SELECT auth.uid()));
```

#### Similarity Search Function

Implemented an efficient similarity search stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_documents(
  query_embedding vector(1024),
  match_count int,
  filter_user_id uuid,
  filter_files text[],
  similarity_threshold float
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id uuid,
  text_content text,
  title text,
  doc_timestamp date,
  ai_title text,
  ai_description text,
  ai_maintopics text[],
  ai_keyentities text[],
  filter_tags text,
  page_number int,
  total_pages int,
  chunk_number int,
  total_chunks int,
  similarity float
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    vd.id,
    vd.text_content,
    vd.title,
    vd."timestamp" as doc_timestamp,
    vd.ai_title,
    vd.ai_description,
    vd.ai_maintopics,
    vd.ai_keyentities,
    vd.filter_tags,
    vd.page_number,
    vd.total_pages,
    vd.chunk_number,
    vd.total_chunks,
    1 - (vd.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  FROM
    vector_documents vd
  WHERE
    vd.user_id = filter_user_id
    AND vd.filter_tags = ANY(filter_files)
    AND 1 - (vd.embedding <=> query_embedding) > similarity_threshold
  ORDER BY
    vd.embedding <=> query_embedding ASC
  LIMIT LEAST(match_count, 200);
END;
$$;
```
